N/A

## Usage
```python

## Contributing
See [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Build
To make a PyPI package...
```bash
python setup.py sdist
```

## Test
Before you open a pull request, your code must have passing
[pytest](http://pytest.org) unit tests. In addition, you should include a set of
functional tests written to use a real BIG-IP device for testing. Information on
how to run our set of tests is included below.

#### Unit Tests
We use pytest for our unit tests
1. If you haven't already, install the required test packages and the requirements.txt in your virtual environment.
```shell
$ pip install hacking pytest pytest-cov
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2. Run the tests and produce a coverage repor.  The `--cov-report=html` will
create a `htmlcov/` directory that you can view in your browser to see the
missing lines of code.
```shell
py.test --cov ./icontrol --cov-report=html
open htmlcov/index.html
```

#### Style Checks
We use the hacking module for our style checks (installed as part of
step 1 in the Unit Test section).
```shell
flake8 ./
```
