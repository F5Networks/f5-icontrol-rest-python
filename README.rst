Introduction
------------

This generic python library allows programs and other modules to
interact with the BIG-IP速 iControl速 REST API.

**If you want to use python to automate BIG-IP速 devices via the REST API, use the  F5 SDK** (`F5Networks/f5-common-python <https://github.com/F5Networks/f5-common-python>`_).

Installation
------------

Using Pip
`````````

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install f5-icontrol-rest


Installing directly from GitHub
```````````````````````````````

**NOTE:** The example below installs the package at release v0.1.0. Omitting the version number will install the package from the current state of the default branch.

.. code:: shell

    $ pip install git+ssh://git@github.com/F5Networks/f5-icontrol-rest@v0.1.0`


Configuration
-------------
N/A

Usage
-----

.. code:: python

    from icontrol.session import iControlRESTSession
    icr_session = iControlRESTSession('myuser', 'mypass')
    icr_session.get(
        'https://bigip.example.com/mgmt/tm/ltm/nat',
        name='mynat',
        partition='Common')

Build
`````

To make a PyPI package:

.. code:: bash

    $ python setup.py sdist


Test
````
Before you open a pull request, your code must have passing `pytest <http://pytest.org>`__ unit tests. In addition, you should include a set of functional tests written to use a real BIG-IP速 for testing. Information on how to run our set of tests is included below.

Unit Tests
~~~~~~~~~~

We use pytest for our unit tests.

1. If you haven't already, install the required test packages listed in requirements.test.txt in your virtual
environment.

.. code:: shell

    $ pip install -r requirements.test.txt


2. Run the tests and produce a coverage report. The ``--cov-report=html``
   will create a ``htmlcov/`` directory that you can view in your browser to see the missing lines of code.

.. code:: shell

   $ py.test --cov ./icontrol --cov-report=html
   $ open htmlcov/index.html


Style Checks
~~~~~~~~~~~~
We use the hacking module for our style checks (installed as part of
step 1 in the Unit Test section).

.. code:: shell

    $ flake8 ./
