    pip install f5-icontrol-rest

Installing directly from GitHub
```````````````````````````````

*Note:* This will install the package at release v0.1.0.

Usage
-----

.. code:: python

    from icontrol.session import iControlRESTSession
    icr_session = iControlRESTSession('myuser', 'mypass')
    icr_session.get(
        'https://bigip.example.com/mgmt/tm/ltm/nat',

Build
-----

To make a PyPI package...

.. code:: bash

    python setup.py sdist

Test
----

Before you open a pull request, your code must have passing
`pytest <http://pytest.org>`__ unit tests. In addition, you should
include a set of functional tests written to use a real BIG-IP device
for testing. Information on how to run our set of tests is included
below.

Unit Tests
``````````

We use pytest for our unit tests 1. If you haven't already, install the
required test packages and the requirements.txt in your virtual
environment.

.. code:: shell

    $ pip install hacking pytest pytest-cov
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Run the tests and produce a coverage repor. The ``--cov-report=html``
   will create a ``htmlcov/`` directory that you can view in your
   browser to see the missing lines of code.

   .. code:: shell

       py.test --cov ./icontrol --cov-report=html
       open htmlcov/index.html

Style Checks
````````````

We use the hacking module for our style checks (installed as part of
step 1 in the Unit Test section).

.. code:: shell

    flake8 ./
